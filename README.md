PetColorCreator
===============



Pet Name Color Generator is a java application that i have coded with will allow you to easely create your pets name in the colors that you want
Plus i have added the fancy tags


The only thing i cant add to this is the random letter number symbol thingy
because there is no HTML tag for it :(
